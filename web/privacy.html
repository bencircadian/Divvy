        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored securely using industry-standard practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> We use Supabase, a secure backend service, to store your account and task data. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The app stores data locally on your device using encrypted storage (Hive with AES encryption) to enable offline functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use secure authentication through Supabase Auth, with optional Google and Apple Sign-In for added convenience and security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information only in these circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With Household Members:</strong> Task and household information is shared with members of your household as part of the app's core functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party services (Supabase for backend, Google/Apple for authentication) that process data on our behalf under strict privacy agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Export your data</li>
            <li>Opt out of non-essential communications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
